The dataset includes 1032 images.
Chip-ne7R are annotated in YOLOv8 Oriented Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 320x320 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 4.5 pixels
